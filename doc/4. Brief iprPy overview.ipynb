    "# 4. Brief iprPy overview as an extension of yabadaba\n",
    "\n",
    "While iprPy was one of the original packages that yabadaba branched out from, it can now be thought of as extending yabadaba's capabilities to support performing calculations individually and in high throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Thinking of iprPy in this way is new and still in development.  Ideally, a goal for this upcoming year is to extract out the core functionalities of iprPy from the IPR-specific content (yabadabado?), but lots of work to do.  As such, some of what is described here is currently only conceptual related to wanted features.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extending yabadaba\n",
    "\n",
    "At the most basic level, the design of iprPy extends what yabadaba does in three primary ways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A base Calculation class extends the base Record class with functionality for managing the execution of a calculation function.\n",
    "2. (*planned*) InputValue and ResultValue classes extend Value with calculation-centric operations.\n",
    "3. The Database class is also extended with methods supporting the design and execution of high throughput workflows of calculations."

    "## High throughput outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an extremely brief overview of how the high throughput workflow is set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The workflow is designed around the text input files.  When you run a single calculation from the text files, each input parameter can have only a single value.  This is indicated by the first \"key\" value needing to be unique.  Alternatively, the input content can be given in Python as a flat dict where each term has a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High throughput runs of the calculation can then be specified by giving multiple values for some of the inputs.  For simple ht operations, this can be done using a text input where some input parameter terms show up on repeated lines.  Alternatively, the dict version of the input can have lists of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When defining the Calculation class, the input parameters are divided into sets depending on if they are allowed to have multiple values, and if so if they should be iterated in conjunction with any other parameters.  Additional metadata also indicates which input fields should be used to compare for uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The lists of values can also be automatically built based on existing records/calculations in the database.  This allows for the design of workflows consisting of multiple calculations.  This does, however, require users to define the \"buildcombos\" functions to use to map records to input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Running the calculations is then a 2-step process: \"prepare\" generates the set of new calculations to run, and \"runner\" sequentially executes the calculations.  Multiple runners can operate on the same set of prepared calculations allowing for free control on how many jobs are currently active and how many cores each job uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, for established multi-calculation workflows, \"master_prepare\" branches can be defined for a Calculation that collect the standard input + buildcombos sets.  In this way, the default values are specified and the user only has to give modifications. "
